1. System requirements
----------------------

Star SUDOKU is written in JAVA programming language, this means that it can be run on any Operating System which has JAVA Runtime Environment (JRE).

You need JRE 1.5.0 (also know as JRE 5) or above. If you have an older JRE version then you will get an error message and the program will exit.   

You can download JRE for free at www.java.com  


2. Running JETRIS on your system
--------------------------------

To start JETRIS try one of the following options: 

* Double click on the JAR File to start JETRIS. If this didn't work, then you didn't associate your JAR Files with your JRE. 

* Double click on JETRIS.bat for Windows users or on JETRIS for Linux users.

* Open the console go to your JETRIS folder and type: 

java -jar JETRIS.jar

For example: 
------------
You have a Windows Operating System, your JETRIS folder is C:\JETRIS then:

Open Start Menu -> Run type "cmd" in the console type "cd C:\JETRIS" hit Enter then type "java -jar JETRIS.jar" hit Enter


3. How to play
--------------

Use the following keys to play JETRIS:

	* A or Left Arrow - Move the figure to left
	
	* D or Right Arrow - Move the figure to right
	
	* W or Up Arrow - Rotate the figure
	
	* S or Down Arrow - Move the figure quick down
	
	* Space - Drop the figure immediately
	
	* P or 'Pause' Button - Pause
	
	* R or 'Restart' Button - Restart
	
	* H - View HiScore
	
	* Esc - Exit


4. Scoring System
-----------------

* Clearing 1 Line at once, gives You 100 points + 5 x the current level

* Clearing 2 Line at once, gives You 400 points + 20 x the current level

* Clearing 3 Line at once, gives You 900 points + 45 x the current level

* Clearing 4 Line at once, gives You 1600 points + 80 x the current level

For example: 
------------

The current level is 20 (the highest level) and You clear 4 Lines at once, then You get 1600 + 80 x 20 = 2 x 1600 = 3200. So on level 20 you are making twice as much points as on level 0.



5. Saving your old HiScores after version update
------------------------------------------------

Copy the old JETRIS.dat File to your new version of jetris folder.
